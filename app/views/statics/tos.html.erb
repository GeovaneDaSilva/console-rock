When We collect this information, We only use this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify Your Agents or End-Users personally.

Downgrading Your Service Plan may cause loss of content, features, or capacity of the Service as available to You under Your Account, and <%= I18n.t("application.name") %> does not accept any liability for such loss.
    </p>

    <p>
      6.4 Unless otherwise stated, Our charges do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments, including value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes assessable by any local, state, provincial or foreign jurisdiction (collectively “Taxes”). You are responsible for paying Taxes, except those assessable against <%= I18n.t("application.name") %> measured by its net income. We will invoice You for such Taxes if We believe We have a legal obligation to do so and You agree to pay such Taxes if so invoiced.
    </p>

    <p>
      6.5 If You pay by credit card or certain other payment instruments, the Services provide an interface for the Account owner to change credit card information (e.g. upon card renewal). The Account owner will receive a receipt upon each acceptance of payment by the Payment Agent, or they may obtain a receipt from within the Services to track subscription status. You hereby authorize the Payment Agent to bill Your credit card or other payment instrument in advance on a periodic basis in accordance with the terms of the Service Plan for the Services and for periodic Subscription Charges applicable to Deployed Associated Services to which You subscribe until Your subscription to the Services terminates, and You further agree to pay any Subscription Charges so incurred. If applicable, You hereby authorize <%= I18n.t("application.name") %> and the Payment Agent to charge Your credit card or other payment instrument to establish such prepaid credit. You agree to promptly update Your Account information with any changes (for example, a change in Your billing address or credit card expiration date) that may occur. The Payment Agent uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing and this intermediary is not permitted to store, retain or use Your billing information except to process Your credit card information for the Payment Agent.
    </p>

    <p>
      6.6 Payments made by credit card, debit card or certain other payment instruments for the <%= I18n.t("application.name") %> Service are billed and processed by <%= I18n.t("application.name") %>’s Payment Agent. To the extent the Payment Agent is not <%= I18n.t("application.name") %>, the Payment Agent is acting solely as a billing and processing agent for and on behalf of <%= I18n.t("application.name") %> and shall not be construed to be providing the applicable Service.
    </p>

    <p>
      6.7 If You mandate <%= I18n.t("application.name") %> use a vendor payment portal or compliance portal which charges <%= I18n.t("application.name") %> a subscription fee or a percentage of any uploaded invoice as a required
    cost of doing business, You shall be invoiced by <%= I18n.t("application.name") %> for, and You are obligated to pay, the cost of this fee.
    </p>

    <h2>7. PROMOTIONAL CREDITS POLICY</h2>

    <p>
      We may, at Our sole discretion, choose to offer credits for the Services in various ways, including but not limited to, coupons, promotional campaigns and referrals for <%= I18n.t("application.name") %> services such as training. <%= I18n.t("application.name") %> reserves the right to award credits at its sole discretion. Credits have no monetary or cash value and can only be used by You to offset Your subsequent payments of Subscription Charges for the applicable Service. Credits may only be applied to Subscription Charges due for the Service specifically identified by <%= I18n.t("application.name") %> when issuing the credit. Credits can only be used by You and are non- transferable. To the extent that You have been awarded credits, unless the instrument (including any coupon) states an earlier expiration date, credits shall expire and no longer be redeemable twelve (12) months from the date the credit was issued.
    </p>

    <h2>8. CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION</h2>

      8.1 Either Party may elect to terminate Your Account and subscription to a Service as of the end of Your then current Subscription Term by providing notice, in accordance with this Agreement, on or prior to the date thirty (30) days preceding the end of such Subscription Term. Unless Your Account and subscription to a Service is so terminated, Your subscription to a Service (including any and all Deployed Associated Services) will renew for a Subscription Term equivalent in length to the then expiring Subscription Term. Unless otherwise provided for in an Order Form, the Subscription Charges applicable to Your subscription to a Service for any such subsequent Subscription Term shall be Our standard Subscription Charges for the Service Plan and Deployed Associated Services to which You have subscribed or which You have deployed, as applicable, as of the time such subsequent Subscription Term commences.

This amount will not be payable by You in the event You terminate Your subscription to a Service or cancel Your Account as a result of a material breach of this Agreement by <%= I18n.t("application.name") %>, provided that You provide advance notice of such breach to <%= I18n.t("application.name") %> and afford <%= I18n.t("application.name") %> no less than thirty (30) days to reasonably cure such breach as provided for in Section 8.5 herein.

Unless legally prohibited from doing so, We will use commercially reasonable efforts to contact You directly via email to notify You when taking any of the foregoing actions. We shall not be liable to You, Agents, End-Users or any other third party for any such modification, suspension or discontinuation of Your rights to access and use the Services. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity by You, Agents or End-Users may be referred to law enforcement authorities at Our sole discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      8.5 A Party may terminate this Agreement for cause (a) upon written notice to the other Party of a material breach if such breach remains uncured at the expiration of thirty (30) days from the date of the breaching Party’s receipt of such notice; or (b) if the other Party becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors. If this Agreement is terminated by You in accordance with this section, We will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, refund You any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the Subscription Term after the effective date of termination. If this Agreement is terminated by Us in accordance with this section, You will pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the Subscription Term pursuant to all applicable Order Forms. In no event will termination relieve You of Your obligation to pay any fees payable to Us for the period prior to the effective date of termination.
    </p>
    <p>
      8.6 Upon request by You made within thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination or expiration of this Agreement, We will make Service Data available to You for export or download as provided in the Documentation. After such 30-day period, We will have no obligation to maintain or provide any Service Data, and, as provided in the Documentation, will have the right to delete or destroy all copies of Service Data in Our systems or otherwise in Our possession or control, unless prohibited by law.

    <h2 class="text-center">SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>
    <h2 class="text-center">HOW WE PROTECT YOUR DATA</h2>
    <p>
      <%= I18n.t("application.name") %> is committed to providing a robust and comprehensive security program including the security measures set forth in these Supplemental Terms (“Security Measures”). During the Subscription Term, these Security Measures may change without notice, as standards evolve or as additional controls are implemented or existing controls are modified as We deem reasonably necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Security Measures Utilized by Us
    </p>
    <p>
      As provided for in Section 3.2 of the Agreement, We will abide by these Security Measures to protect Service Data as is reasonably necessary to provide the Services:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Security Policies and Personnel. We have and will maintain a managed security program to identify risks and implement preventative technology, as well as technology and processes for common attack mitigation. This program is and will be reviewed on a regular basis to provide for continued effectiveness and accuracy. We have, and will maintain, a full-time information security team responsible for monitoring and reviewing security infrastructure for Our networks, systems and services, responding to security incidents, and developing and delivering training to Our employees in compliance with Our security policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Data Transmission. We will maintain commercially reasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of Service Data. These safeguards include encryption of Service Data in transmission (using TLS or similar technologies) over the internet, except for any Third Party Services that does not support encryption, which You may link to through the Services at Your election.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Incident Response. We have an incident management process for security events that may affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of Our systems or data that includes a response time under which <%= I18n.t("application.name") %> will contact its subscribers upon verification of a security incident that affects Your Service Data. This process specifies courses of action, procedures for notification, escalation, mitigation, and documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Access Control and Privilege Management. We restrict administrative access to subscriber production systems to operational personnel. We require such personnel to have unique IDs and associated cryptographic keys. These keys are used to authenticate and identify each person’s activities on Our systems, including access to Service Data. Upon hire, Our operational personnel are assigned unique keys. Upon termination, these keys are revoked. Access rights and levels are based on Our employees’ job function and role, using the concepts of least-privilege and need-to-know to match access privileges to defined responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Network Management and Security. The data centers utilized by Us maintain industry standard fully redundant and secure network architecture with reasonably sufficient bandwidth as well as redundant network infrastructure to mitigate the impact of individual component failure. Our security team utilizes industry standard utilities to provide defense against known common unauthorized network activity, monitors security advisory lists for vulnerabilities, and undertakes regular external vulnerability audits.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Data Center Environment and Physical Security. The data center environments which are utilized by Us in connection with Our provision of the Service employ the following security measures:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      2. System Access Controls. Third-party service providers shall take reasonable measures to prevent data processing systems from being used without authorization. These controls shall vary based on the nature of Processing undertaken and may include, among other controls, authentication via passwords and/or two-factor authentication, documented authorization processes, documented change management processes, and/or logging of access on several levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Data Access Controls. Third-party service providers shall take reasonable measures to provide that Service Data is accessible and manageable only by properly authorized staff, direct database query access is restricted and application access rights are established and enforced to ensure that persons entitled to access Service Data only have access to Service Data to which they have privilege of access; and, that Service Data cannot be read, copied, modified or removed without authorization in the course of Processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Transmission Controls. Third-party service providers shall take reasonable measures to ensure that it is possible to check and establish to which entities the transfer of Service Data by means of data transmission facilities is envisaged so Service Data cannot be read, copied, modified or removed without authorization during electronic transmission or transport.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Input Controls. Third-party service providers shall take reasonable measures designed to ensure that it is possible to check and establish whether and by whom Service Data has been entered into data processing systems, modified or removed; and, any of transfer of Service Data to a third-party service provider is made via a secure transmission.
